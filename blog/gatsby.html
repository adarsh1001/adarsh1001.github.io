                  “Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, just remember that all the people in this world
                  haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.” Scott Fitzgerald starts his masterpiece
                  with this quote and I feel like I should follow in his footsteps while starting this review
                  because it straightaway warns us that the story would be filled with diverse characters
                  entangled in complicated situations and in the end, we would be left with a list of
                  characters divided into like and dislike categories. After reading the novel twice, I can
                  firmly say that no two readers would have an identical list as I found myself
                  contradicting my first list after my second read. That being said, I feel that the Great
                  Gatsby is one of the most interesting and informative pieces of fiction I’ve read in a long
                  time. “Informative” is not a common adjective for a fictional story but the way Fitzgerald
                  juxtaposes the imagery of the roaring twenties in his fictional narrative, one cannot deny
                  absorbing some part of America themselves. In its core, the story is a romantic tragedy
                  which revolves around a character who shares his name with the title of this novel. A
                  plethora of themes, symbols and metaphors are employed by the author throughout the
                  story to tickle our brain cells which we shall try to uncover in the paragraphs below.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/gatsby.jpg" alt="The Great Gatsby"></p>
            <p style="font-family:verdana;" align="left">
                  The Great Gatsby is set in the 1920s which is now fondly remembered as the “roaring
                  twenties”. The Great War was over and America was roaring along the route of
                  economic prosperity. This was the time when the jazz and flapper culture actually grew
                  momentum. The sale of alcohol was not permitted during this time but since humans
                  and alcohol have a bond older than time perhaps, bootlegging business was rampant.
                  Fitzgerald plausibly depicts this era in the background of his story giving us a feel of the
                  America then. A major part of the story takes place in the summer of 1922 in the New
                  York City and Long Island, specifically the fictional towns of East and West Egg which
                  were separated by a sound and housed the wealthiest of families. The route from the
                  West Egg to the New York City was through a town known as the Valley of Ashes which
                  served as the dumping ground of the rich. This contrasting town layout is similar to the
                  upper and lower decks of the ship in the Hairy Ape. The entire novel is written in first
                  person and narrated by Nick Carraway who is essentially an outsider looking in. At
                  times, you’ll find Nick present at the scene and talking about the scene through his eyes
                  whereas at other times, the scene is described by Nick without him being present there.
                  This transition between Nick and Fitzgerald is really subtle and gives a unique flavor to
                  the novel. The tone of the novel keeps shifting from joyful romance to melancholic
                  drama. By the time you finish the novel, you’ll feel as if you’re getting down from an
                  emotion-filled roller-coaster ride.
               </p>
            
               <p style="font-family:verdana;" align="left">
                  As I mentioned in the first paragraph itself, the Great Gatsby is a romantic tragedy
                  similar to Romeo and Juliet and would have perhaps been identical in terms of the main
                  plot line had Juliet married Paris whilst she was in love with Romeo. The story starts
                  with our beloved narrator, Nick Carraway, moving into a cottage beside Jay Gatsby’s
                  mansion in the West Egg. In the early parts of the story, Nick’s information about Gatsby
                  is limited to that fact that he is a millionaire who throws extravagant parties for all. Their
                  bond slowly builds up over the course of the story until they become the very best of
                  friends in the end. Nick has a cousin sister by the name Daisy who lives in a mansion in
                  the East Egg along with her husband, Tom Buchanan who serves as the primary
                  antagonist of this story. Now here’s where things get complicated. Tom is cheating on
                  Daisy with another married girl, Myrtle and our protagonist, Gatsby, is madly obsessed
                  with Daisy and wants to win her over at all costs. Consequently, the entire plot hinges on
                  Daisy’s dilemma and can go either way based on her decision. Every good piece of
                  fiction has a climax and so does this story. As you may have already guessed by now,
                  there occurs a battle between Tom and Gatsby with Daisy being the prize. No, not a
                  battle with swords and guns but with words and secrets which we all know can get just
                  as ugly and messy. The climax of this story is the event when Daisy accidentally kills
                  Tom’s mistress. So what happens in the end? I’ve already spoiled the reader of my
                  review enough but I’m sure that the comparisons that I’ve made to Romeo and Juliet as
                  well as the Hairy Ape give you a fairly clear image of the tragedy that befalls our
                  protagonist.
               </p>
               
               <p style="font-family:verdana;" align="left">
                  Now that we’re familiar with the setting and the plot, let’s take a look at the diverse cast
                  of characters that Fitzgerald cooked up for this story. We have to start with our narrator
                  Nick Carraway since we’re seeing everything from his perspective. Nick, as most men in
                  the early 1900s, participated in the Great War. His family hailed from the Mid-Western
                  part of America and after his graduation from New Haven in 1915, he moved to the East
                  to study the bond business. He is an epitome of a typical middle class working
                  salaryman who had casual affairs by the side, especially with Daisy’s friend Jordan
                  Baker who is a slender but stern sportswoman with a self-centered attitude and is
                  portrayed as a regular 20th century flapper girl. Nick has a very friendly and
                  understanding personality making people open up to him naturally. As he himself
                  states, “I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known”. He is one of those
                  gifted people who stay by their friends even in the hour of need. The central character of
                  this story is, no surprises here, Jay Gatsby himself. The main question that even the title
                  subconsciously asks is, “Is Gatsby really great?”. When we are first introduced to
                  Gatsby, he seems like a lavish, successful and extravagant person and has, as Nick
                  says, something gorgeous about him. Not only does he reside in a grand mansion, he
                  throws extraordinary parties even for strangers. Mysterious, ain’t it? In the initial pages
                  of the novel, you can’t help but interpret “great” as used for successful historical figures
                  like Alexander or Caesar. But as the story progresses, Nick and therefore we find out
                  about his obsession with a married woman, Daisy and about the fact that his wealth
                  resulted from his bootlegging business. At this point, many of us would have perhaps
                  mockingly enunciated, “Oh! That’s just ‘great’!”, giving another interpretation to the title.
                  All in all, Gatsby is a war veteran who has an extraordinary gift for hope and romantic
                  readiness. He is so passionate about Daisy that we can’t help but award him with the
                  title of Romeo, a quixotic Romeo perhaps. Even though he was born in a poor family, he
                  never let his American Dreams out of his sight and died in pursuit of it. Throughout his
                  life, Gatsby played many different roles and to perfection making us wonder whether
                  Fitzgerald used the term “great” as a stage name like that of the Great Houdini. The
                  story is incomplete without our beautiful Juliet, Daisy Buchanan. She is cynical about
                  most people and acts in a rather superficial manner making it difficult for us to actually
                  interpret her real emotions. She fell in love with Gatsby when he was an officer but
                  moves on to marrying Tom after waiting several years for Gatsby to show up. The lack
                  of responsibility she exhibits after killing Myrtle and her decision to leave Gatsby in the
                  hour of need shows that she is in love with money and material luxury. She is capable of
                  showering genuine affection towards others but not of sustained loyalty. Her husband,
                  Tom Buchanan, unlike Gatsby, comes from a wealthy household and has a sturdy
                  muscled body with an equally arrogant attitude. Arrogance is something that the rich
                  inherit along with their wealth. His single-minded and racist comments puts off people
                  like me who are reading this novel in the 21st century. Swinging his wife in one hand
                  and Myrtle in the other seems natural to him. Myrtle is married to George Wilson who is,
                  fortunately for Tom, a lifeless exhausted worker in the valley of ashes but like Gatsby,
                  wants to pursue the fantasy of love and the American Dream. In my judgement, Myrtle is
                  just trying to elevate her status in the society by running away with Tom.
               </p>
               
               <p style="font-family:verdana;" align="left">
                  Being a romantic tragedy, love, marriage and relationships constitute the central theme
                  of the story. Fitzgerald explores many different types of relationships in his narrative.
                  Tom and Daisy and George and Myrtle are the only two couples in the story and both the
                  marriages lack the spark of love and feel more like an advantage than matrimonial
                  unification. Both Tom and Myrtle are unfaithful to their marriage partners and Fitzgerald
                  shows us the melancholic consequences that such relationships yield in the long run.
                  On the sidelines, Fitzgerald also explores casual relationships that people strike up at
                  parties through the lens of Nick. Then we have Gatsby’s all consuming passion for Daisy
                  which is a consequence of their shared history. Gatsby and Daisy’s relationship explores
                  the theme of how our past defines and shapes us. Gatsby’s childish whim of not letting
                  go of the past and moving on with his life takes a heavy toll in the end. Another
                  important theme which is not discussed explicitly but clearly shown in the background
                  is on society and class during the roaring twenties. The diverse imagery that is
                  described through the window of a train ride from the West Egg to NY City says volumes
                  about the conditions that the rich and the poor thrived in. The Valley of Ashes, like the
                  coal deck in the Hairy Ape, represents the moral and social decay that results from the
                  single-minded pursuit of wealth by the upper class. This pursuit of wealth is a part and
                  parcel of the American Dream that everyone wants to achieve but very few can. Gatsby
                  came very close to achieving his dream but ultimately, succumbed to the wrath of the
                  upper class. George, on the other hand, couldn’t even break the shackles that the
                  society had imprisoned him in to take the first step. Clearly, both our hairy apes fail in
                  their endeavor. One interesting thing to note is that almost everyone in the story wears a
                  facade of some sort and lies for convenience. Even our beloved narrator, who tells us to
                  be neutral to people’s characters, ends up clouding his own neutral lens towards the
                  end. To be fair, if everyone in the story was an honest saint, we’d be reading a holy
                  scripture and not a dramatic piece of fiction.                  
               </p>

               <p style="font-family:verdana;" align="left">
                  Every writer has some weapons in their arsenal and symbolism is Fitzgerald’s weapon
                  of choice in this story. Symbols and metaphors give a very authentic and satisfying feel
                  to the reader. Nick often finds Gatsby staring at a bright green light present at the dock
                  of the East Egg with his arms trying to reach for it. For Gatsby, this light is the
                  personification of Daisy herself who constitutes a big portion of his American Dream.
                  When Daisy and Gatsby are together for a brief period, this light disappeared from
                  Gatsby’s life. So in general, the green light symbolizes his hopes and dreams. Another
                  very clear symbol that Fitzgerald points to multiple times is the billboard poster with the
                  fading, bespectacled eyes of T. J. Eckleburg overlooking the Valley of Ashes. The Valley
                  itself is a symbol depicting the social and moral decay through the plight of the poor
                  resulting from the rich not paying any attention to anything but wealth and luxury. The
                  eyes of T. J. Eckleburg may represent the all mighty God looking down upon the moral
                  wasteland that America has embraced in pursuit of the American Dream. Fitzgerald
                  also takes a lot of liberty with colors. The light that Gatsby chases after is bright green,
                  a color often associated with hope and liberation. He drives a yellow colored car which
                  which the author might have used to show his wealth and nobility. Moreover, we often
                  see Daisy, Jordan and Gatsby in white clothes which is a striking contrast to their gray
                  personalities. Speaking of gray, the Valley of Ashes is painted in black and white as
                  though the author wanted us to observe the contrast between the rich and poor
                  societies.                                                             
               </p>

               <p style="font-family:verdana;" align="left">
                  So will I recommend The Great Gatsby to another human? Yes, absolutely. Even though
                  Fitzgerald pulls off a Shakespeare in the end and leaves the audience chasing after their
                  idealistic fantasies, the novel provides an insightful view into the America during the
                  roaring twenties and Fitzgerald does an impressive job of blending a dramatic narrative
                  with artistic and informative elements making it worth every second of your time. The
                  novel is well crafted and easy to read and relate to. A big thumbs up from my side!
