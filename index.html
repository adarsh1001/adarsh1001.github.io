            <h2>My Journey In A Nutshell</h2>

            <p align="justify">I'm a Bachelor's + MS by Research Dual Degree ECE student at IIIT Hyderabad, India. My MS is on the 
               topic of Machine Learning for Smarter IoT Systems. 
               I've published 2 papers as part of my MS and am currently working on my thesis. I've 
               been the recepient of the Dean's List Award 6 times in a row for my academic performance. 
               During the course of my engineering, I served in 2 different companies as an intern. The first one was 
               the Linux Foundation where I interned for about 6 months in 2018. This was a remote open source internship 
               wherein I collaborated with a team from Huawei (OPNFV Project) to develop a cloud-native stack for edge devices. 
               I received the Gambia Community Award for my contributions to OPNFV and was the only undergrad speaker selected by
               the Linux Foundation to deliver talks at the Open Networking Summit and the OPNFV Plugfest. In the 
               summer of 2019, I interned in the AI/ML team of Ernst & Young, Bangalore. I had a dual role
               of a DevOps as well as a Machine Learning Engineer. <br>
               I'm an avid book reader. Some of my favorites include The Scarlet Letter, Maud's Line, The Girl On The Train, 
               Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman and The Martian. I also love reading Japanese manga. One Piece is my absolute 
               favorite. I own an Ibanez acoustic guitar and can be found strumming to the Beatles or Oasis in the afternoons if 
               I'm not in the badminton court or hooked to some Netflix series.

                     in the AI/ML team of E&Y. <br>
                     I worked on the problem of clustering in high dimensional sentence embeddings

                  in the OPNFV project for a period of 6 months. The crux of my work was to implement a kubernetes-based 
                  small-footprint edge cluster supporting cloud-native framework and develop exemplar microservice-oriented 
                  applications for the edge as well as the edge-cloud paradigm of the future. <br>
                  In the first phase, a versatile Ansible script was developed to form a k8s cluster out of 2+ Raspberry Pi 3 
                  devices. Exemplar microservice apps, containerized using Docker, were developed and tested on this edge cluster. 
                  In particular, a low-latency real-time video streaming app employing UV4L was developed and tested. <br>
                  The next phase focused on an edge-cloud paradigm for ML apps. A demo was created for ONS-18 which involved containerizing 
                  a YOLO-based real-time object detector for this edge as well as GKE (with Nvidia P100 GPU) and highlighting 
                  the pros and cons of a collaborative ML paradigm. <br>
                  I received the <b><a href="https://wiki.opnfv.org/display/DEV/Gambia+Award+Winners" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(7, 89, 109)">Gambia Community Award</a></b> in the intern category. 
                  I also got 2 opportunities to present my work- 
                  one at the <b><a href="https://sched.co/FmsC" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(7, 89, 109)">Open Networking Summit</a></b>,

			      <h4>Lightning Talk: "Edge Cloud-Native Cluster", OPNFV Plugfest, Paris 2019</h4>
			      <p align="justify">
                  One of the biggest perks of interning in the Linux Foundation Networking (LFN) program is that you get a fully 
                  sponsored trip to an LF event. Not only that, you also get to present your work as a 10-15 minute lightning talk to a 
                  room full of industry experts! My internship concluded successfully in December 2018 and I began packing my bags 
                  for this trip in the second week of January itself. 
               </p>
               <p align="justify">
                  This time around (2019), the OPNFV plugfest was not a standalone LF event. Rather, a combined OPNFV Plugfest and 
                  ONAP DDF took place for 4 whole days at Nokia Paris-Saclay. I got to attend tons of exciting talks and tutorials 
                  that were undertaken by the developers from various companies like Redhat, China Mobile, Huawei, Intel. 
                  The intern talks were scheduled early morning on the last day of the event. I've 
                  attached my presentation below which is pretty self-explanatory.

                  I was only halfway through my LFN internship when one day my mentor, Wenjing Chu, suggested that we should 
                  submit a talk proposal for the Europe edition of the Open Networking Summit (2018). He was convinced that our
                  work on edge-cloud and collaborative machine learning was something that companies would be interested in. And 
                  sure enough, our proposal was accepted by LF to be presented as a 10 minute lightning talk. I've attached our 
                  presentation below which is pretty much self-explanatory.

			      <h4>Raspberry Pi Kubernetes Cluster</h4>
			      <p align="justify">
                  As the heading suggests, this project revolves around the creation of a kubernetes cluster using 2 or more 
                  Raspberry Pi devices (ARM-based). After manually playing with docker and kubernetes on the RPi for weeks, I 
                  developed a versatile Ansible script that can create and disassemble clusters with ease. You can try it out 
                  yourself if you own at least 2 Raspberry Pi devices. An exemplar containerized app is also included in the repo 
                  which can help you get started with your own edge cluster-based projects.

			      <h4>Hand Segmentation Using RefineNet</h4>
			      <p align="justify">
                  The aim of this project was to develop an egocentric hand segmentation model using RefineNet in Python3. 
                  For this, we worked with two CVPR papers and replicated the results using our own implementation in PyTorch (the 
                  authors had written the code in Matlab). The PyTorch implementation of RefineNet (which is a multipath 
                  refinement network over ResNet) was done from scratch. After that, the model was trained on the standard 
                  Pascal person-parts dataset with a new binary layer of hand and no-hand. The model was further fine-tuned on 
                  four different ego-centric hands datasets.

                  <b>Abstract-</b> In buildings, a large chunk of energy is spent on heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. 
                  One way to optimize their usage is to make them demand-driven depending on human occupancy. 
                  This paper focuses on accurately estimating the number of occupants in a room by leveraging multiple 
                  heterogeneous sensor nodes and machine learning models. For this purpose, low-cost and non-intrusive 
                  sensors such as CO2, temperature, illumination, sound and motion were used. The sensor nodes were 
                  deployed in a room in a star configuration and measurements were recorded for a period of four days. 
                  A regression based method is proposed for calculating the slope of CO2, a new feature derived from 
                  real-time CO2 values. Supervised learning algorithms such as LDA, QDA, SVM and random forest (RF) were 
                  used on several 
                  different combinations of feature sets. Moreover, multiple performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 score 
                  and confusion matrix were used to evaluate the performance of our models. Experimental results demonstrate 
                  a maximum accuracy of 98.4% and a high F1 score of 0.953 for estimating the number of occupants in the room. 
                  PCA was also applied to evaluate the performance of a dataset with reduced 
                  dimensionality.

			      <h4>World Rank 24 at NASA's CanSat Competition 2018</h4>

                  Worked part-time for around 5 months on the CanSat 2018 mission statement along with 8 other IIITians.

               <p align="justify">
                  The mission statement of CanSat 2018 was to construct a small satellite containing various sensors such as 
                  temperature, pressure, accelerometer, voltage and GPS, a microcontroller and a communication radio. A payload 
                  section was also to be designed for protecting a delicate instrument. During the final launch, an egg was put in this 
                  section. The CanSat was also armed with a heat shield and a parachute. As per the problem statement, the 
                  CanSat was to be dropped from a height of around 700m. It was expected to perform a series of manoeuvres such as 
                  letting go of the heat shield and opening the parachute at certain altitudes, sending telemetry data to the 
                  ground control every second and most importantly, remain steady enough to ensure that the egg in the payload 
                  section doesn't break even after impact.

               <p align="justify">
                  All of us in the CanSat team grew up watching science fiction movies. To create something like this from 
                  scratch was an amazing experience. I still can't explain the feeling I got when I learnt that the egg in 
                  our payload section didn't even have a scratch on it! For more details, please visit the following link.

			      <h4>Song Popularity Predictor</h4>
			      <p align="justify">
                  The aim of this project was to determine the popularity of songs using its musical features as well as other 
                  song metrics. We started with the analysis of the million song dataset (MSD). The dataset required a lot of 
                  preprocessing before it could be used in any way. After that, traditional machine learning models were 
                  trained to classify songs into three categories- highly popular, popular and unpopular. Nearest neighbor 
                  exhibited the highest accuracy. Next, we moved onto time-series based experiments as the songs are, of 
                  course, time-series in nature. An LSTM was trained on the time-series features that we had earlier left out. 
                  Since the MSD dataset was quite old, we collected our own dataset consisting of 889 current hit songs and 
                  tested different models on that too. The features were extracted using the PyAudioAnalysis library.

			      <h4>Faster Matrix Algebra Library For Symmetric Matrices In C++ Eigen</h4>
			      <p align="justify">
                  This project was given as a GSoC project by the ATLAS team (part of the Large Hadron Collider project) in 
                  2018. I was initally trying for this internship but then ended up taking the Linux Foundation internship instead. 
                  However, I did complete most of the tasks laid out for the project on my own. 
               </p>
               <p align="justify">
                  In this project, a standalone C++ class was built which can work with Symmetric Matrices on top of the 
                  Eigen Library. Working only with the upper/lower triangular part of a symmetric matrix considerably reduces 
                  the storage space as well as the complexity for different matrix operations. The code exhibits the use 
                  of templates coupled with operator overloading.

			      <h4>Understanding And Predicting Trends In Cryptocurrency Prices Using Data Mining Techniques</h4>
			      <p align="justify">
                  In a span of 10 years, we’ve witnessed the inception and
                  gain in the popularity of the blockchain technology and cryptocurriences. Various cryptocurrencies 
                  have come up and evolved in a short span of time. Just like the regular stock market, the trends of different
                  cryptocurrency coin prices is of great importance to the cryptocurrency traders and investors. 
                  However, unlike the stock market analysis which has been going on for decades, the cryptocurrency market is
                  still referred to as "highly volatile" thereby giving motivation to researchers to contribute to this theme. <br>
                  In this project, data mining techniques were employed to understand different factors affecting Bitcoin and 
                  Etherium, and models were built that can predict different future trends of the market. First, a 
                  binary classification problem was posed (rise/fall of price in a day) and supervised learning techniques
                  were employed on the dataset. 
                  More advanced time-series based techniques were also explored that could predict future values. A comparison 
                  with regular stock market is also presented.

                           <p>I had the pleasure to supervise Adarsh as an intern in a Linux Foundation open source project. 
                              I tend to give my interns an open ended problem to solve and see how far they can go. 
                              Adarsh is one of the rare students who not only has the drive to reach far but also the skills and 
                              dedication to pull it off. His work to investigate the benefit of edge computing with an online 
                              object recognition algorithm is both practical and insightful. I highly recommend Adarsh to anyone.
